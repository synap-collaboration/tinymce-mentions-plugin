To add as a dependency, run `yarn add https://github.com/synap-collaboration/tinymce-mentions-plugin.git`. Branches that add a feature should bump the version number in `package.json` before they're merged into master - running `yarn add` again will automatically pick up on these changes and upgrade the package.
